# TPP and NPA analysis

## Input
Data should be upload via *Data* menu, and click *Load proteomics*. You can upload
 multiple files in the same time. Then, please appoint each file as *case sample #1*, 
 *control sample #1*, *case sample #2*, *control sample #2*. The last two of them are 
 not compulsory. However, experimental replicates are highly recommended for reducing
 the false positive.
