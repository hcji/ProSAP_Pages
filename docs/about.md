# Lab Information

We are an interdisciplinary lab combining methods in data analytics, chemical biology
 and proteomics to 1) elucidate the general principles governing how biomolecular
 interactions are organized and regulated to carry out cellular functions, with a focus on
 2) understanding how the organization is modulated in human diseases and perturbed by chemicals.
 A tenet guiding our research is cellular activities arise from a myriad of physical interactions
 between proteins with metabolites, nucleic acids, lipids and other proteins that are regulated
 in time and space. As such, we develop novel experimental techniques and computational methods
 for system profiling of biomolecular interaction networks underlying various cellular phenotypes.
 We also integrate our interaction data with other “omics” data to understand the interplay between
 different regulatory systems in the cells with applications for cell biology, toxicology and pharmacology.
